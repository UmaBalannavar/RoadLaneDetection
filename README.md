# RoadLaneDetection
Detection of road lanes in images and videos. 

# 🚗 Real-Time Road Lane Detection using Python and OpenCV

This project performs **road lane detection** on both images and videos using edge detection and Hough Transform techniques. It identifies lane lines in road footage by applying Canny edge detection, defining a region of interest, and averaging detected line segments.

---

## 📌 Features

- Detects lane lines from both **static images** and **video streams**
- Uses **Canny Edge Detection** for edge detection
- Applies **Hough Line Transform** to extract line segments
- Handles left and right lane estimation using **slope averaging**
- Works in **real-time** with webcam/video footage

---

## 🛠️ Software & Hardware Used

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib (optional)
- **Hardware:** Basic system with webcam (if using live input)
- **OS:** Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

I learnt this from YouTube and here is the link https://youtu.be/eLTLtUVuuy4?si=NMUmC_RsuSzZrbPe this helped me a lot in understanding openCV in dept thanks to the creator and ive implemented lane detection for both image and video which show one after other .
